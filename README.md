# Rails Themes

Plugin to provide theme support for Rails applications.

## Install

Add to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'rails-themes'
    # gem 'rails-themes', :git => 'https://github.com/fesplugas/rails-themes.git'

## Usage

It expects the following folder structure.

    app_root/
      public/
        themes/
          [theme_name]/
            views/
              layout/
              ...
            assets/
              images/
              javascripts/
              stylesheets/

You specify which theme to use in your controller by using 
the declarative `theme` syntax.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      theme "theme_name"
    end

You can also defer the theme lookup to a controller method:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

      theme :set_theme

      def set_theme
        request.domain
      end

    end
